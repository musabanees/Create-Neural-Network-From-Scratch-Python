## Lets Create a Neural Network from Scratch without Libraries
The problem solution has been divided into 5 sections.
1.	Initializer Network
Firstly, the dataset is collected and contained into suitable variables. A method is formed which is initialized by assigning weights to the network, randomly. A hidden layer as well as an outer layer is constructed. 
2.	Forward Propagation
In forward propagation, weights from the network are calculated. Activation function is applied which returns the predicted values.
3.	Backward Propagation
Network is back propagated by finding out errors from the outer layer, moving towards the inner layer.
4.	Network updation with weights
The weights are updated with new weight values by adding the difference and multiplying them by the learning rate which is 0.01
5.	Training the network
A generic network training function is developed which performs all the above operations in a synchronized manner.
